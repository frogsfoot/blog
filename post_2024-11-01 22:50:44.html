<p>letter #005</p><p><br></p><p>This week was reading week, or mid-terms, or whatever other names it might be called. definitely spent most of it unwinding and focusing on personal projects, like paintings and whatnot. I got a little bit less done [school-work wise] than perhaps i would have liked, but i still feel like i made the most of it! The 9am start with the 1am finish did in fact turn out to be a straight 16 hour shift with no break, because the tour manager [henceforth known as the TM] wanted two venue 'stop-ons', who are crew members that both know where everything got put during load-in, and also know the venue just in case. I think my co-workers were a little cheeky with it because there were two of us in at 9am, for a stage clear before load-in <em>[see glossary]</em>, and then the whole crew appeared for a load-in at 11am. when we had finished, our manager dismissed us and told us to get some rest before load-out, because he's a very lovely little man. when the TM appeared from thin air, she radioed the manager and requested two stop-ons. this is where my co-workers, who had worked a good 2 hours less than me already, slowly turned to me and the other 9am start; and [in a tone reserved almost exclusively for verbal bomb defusal] said "Well, these two have never done a stop-on before. so it would be good experience..?" and then proceeded to leg it to the student union bar. [which we then proceeded to see them at, and eat with them at, when the TM gave us a half hour break. for a newly 16 hour shift. but ok beggars cant be choosers I GUESS?]</p><p><br></p><p>I spent most of the shift complaining about being on a 16 hour shift, but i think if i had ample warning [if i brought a phone charger and a cereal bar] i'd do it again in a heartbeat. stop-ons work directly with the bands and support to make sure everything works. i had some absolutely lovely conversations with the lead singer of one of the support bands, and she came back to give me some stickers after the show! what an icon. I also got to watch the whole show from the exact centre of the house, since that's where the tech desk was. AND AND AND i got a AAA pass! i really should not still be this excited about it, because it is just part of the gig, and i needed it to do my job. but its hung up on my wall and i still can't believe it. it really goes straight to my head, i've started pulling it out in the kitchen in order to get to the microwave if someone's stood in the way. i think im funny. but the combination of working with artists, getting cool little treats and doing loads of exercise makes these shifts really addictive. i think i might actively volunteer for them. they feel so rewarding. the day afterwards feels like i've been cursed by an evil wizard, though.</p><p><br></p><p>And yet, this job is hard! on tuesday i was just on load-out bc i forgot to clear my availabilities for reading week, and had no gig pass, so i had to stand outside the venue by the stage ramp in the freezing october 10pm cold. And i lost One (1) Doc Marten! just the one! she went walkabouts. I have rehearsals every tuesday and thursday, with occasional supplementals on wednesdays (usually intimacy or combat training.) so i had to go straight from my 6-9:30pm rehearsal to my 10pm shift. So i went in something more rehearsal friendly, and brought my work kit and steelies to get changed. I got changed and made sure i had both docs tied to my bag. they were both there when i started my shift. and they were both still there when i finished my shift. there was no way for them to drop off of the bag handles unless i took the bag off and pulled them through. and yet! i come home to my flat at 2am and see One Shoe. How??? where did she go?? I ended up walking BACK through campus with my phone torch checking everywhere i could have dropped it, to the point where i was back at the stage door. and she was nowhere! i think losing one shoe is more embarrassing than losing both. and more devastating. Luckily someone had handed her into the library, and i gave the librarian a good laugh at 10pm when i went to collect her after my wednesday rehearsal. my whole flat cheered when i brought her home. you would not believe me if i said that wasnt even the worst shift of the week. it's a real rollercoaster of a job. I love it, but christ.</p><p><br></p><p>In other words! my flatmates had a bet on whether i could get a date by halloween. the answer was no. i dont quite understand how some people can find someone after like 2 dates? like woah. slow down buckeroo. i'm working on making myself a master at every single skill on the planet and hoping that replaces the need for romance [it wont]</p><p>My flatmate and I spent halloween at the club, because freshers halloween does only come around once in your life. it was a good night, but we didnt have costumes so we went as 'women' because everyone is scared of women. [just an excuse to look nice] there was this insane drag routine that ended with the drag queens pulling up two party goers onto the stage and making them lipsync for their lives. the two contestants were uncle fester and donald trump. and i WISH i could show you how insane uncle fester went. my mans was up and down, death dropping and pole dancing. he very obviously won.</p><p><br></p><p>yet again, i have a 9am-1am tomorrow, but this time i should actually get the 4-10pm break i was promised last time. either way, it is past my bedtime!</p><p><br></p><p><strong><u>GLOSSARY</u></strong>:</p><p>load in: when a touring company come to a venue, they bring their set with them in a van that travels separately to the tour bus, which contains the people. it's the venue tech crew's responsibility to remove the set from the van and load it onto the stage, as well as setting it up. this takes anywhere from 2-5 hours depending on how elaborate it is. The Last Dinner Party's set was gorgeous but minimal, taking us about 2 hours. the band responsible for my 16 hour shift was a lot more elaborate, and took us 4 hours. </p><p>load out: the opposite of that. usually way faster, but way more dangerous because we're tired and cold. two separate people were knocked underneath flight cases last time. [they're alright!]</p>

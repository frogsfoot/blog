<p>hello! if you've found this, you're a little early! this wont be going live until later this month, but i need to make sure it works first.</p><p><br></p><p>I'm heading off into the great big world, where the streets are paved with gold and the houses are made of gingerbread. I'm off to UNIVERSITY! (audience laughs hysterically)</p><p>I'm studying joint honours creative writing/english literature. which are both not real degrees. so hopefully it works a bit like negative numbers and i end up with one normal degree. My brother, who's been there, done that, and got the paper plate to prove it asked me to start a blog of sorts so he could see my plan for world domination unfold in real time (or get some sort of comfort out of me experiencing The Horrors too.) so i'll be updating this [PERIODICALLY]!</p><p><br></p><p>I leave in a little over a month, and i feel prepared even though i know i'm not. i havent bought any pans or stationary, and i've already managed to end up with too many bins. (not a joke ?? ) I am looking forward to it though, as much as i joke about it. Maybe it would be cool/cute/funny to lay down what i want to get out of university before i start, so that in three years time i can laugh at my naivety. I'd like to get to know loads of people, particularly in the art, performance, and film departments. I know my goals are fleeting and i seem to cycle through 14 dream jobs a year, but right now i'd like to work in entertaiment. whether it's theatre or broadcasting. And i think knowing people in those departments is what'll get me far. About 6 months ago i wouldnt stop 'joking' about how my life plan is to find funny people at uni, sell my soul at the Edinburgh Fringe for 6 years straight and then strike gold and immediately retire Julian Barratt style. And honestly that is still on the cards, but i feel like ive learned a lot over the past year -- which i've spent working and saving up; both as a respite from the chains of education, and because my best friend's ex contracted scurvy from refusing to spend his hard earned maintenance loan on veg. Mainly, i've realised that the entertainment world is not friendly to people who arent hot young men. And that it's not that everybody else isnt funny, but rather this insane mind worm everyone's got where they think only boys have the capability to turn on/off the sincere at command. (Just watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XUVrWTuvzA" target="_blank">these</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC6eHraeMes" target="_blank">two</a> clips about the same topic! Do you find the first one a bit heartless? why?) One of my role models (remember those from primary school?) is Lise Mayer, co-writer of The Young Ones. she fought tooth and nail to even be considered part of the crew, despite almost single-handedly coming up with the character concepts and contributing significantly to every single script of every single episode AND being the <em>sole</em> script editor. (when she was <a href="https://youtu.be/-_KEzfmSu9s?si=ZXGyd6TjEBXUkUBE" target="_blank">interviewed by alexei sayle</a>, she casually brings up the most insane shit that she had to grin and bear. it's jawdropping) </p><p>Stories like that make me scared of what i'm getting into, but i know that i'm happiest when im contributing to creative projects -- whether it's prancing about on stage, drafting up a script, or managing props. It'll be a tough road, but its the only road i can see myself walking down.  </p><p><br></p><p>PLAN A: network the hell out of the creative departments -&gt; become people's go-to for projects -&gt; get a juicy portfolio and move on to Big Stuff.</p><p>PLAN B: find funny people -&gt; sell my soul to the edinburgh fringe -&gt; get a bbc 1 comedy show -&gt; retire. occasionally resurface for ad reads on telly.</p><p>PLAN C: get HR qualifications -&gt; easy money office job (been doing HR for my parents unpaid since i was 6)</p><p>PLAN D: just like. die probably?</p><p>PLAN Z: english teacher.</p><p><br></p><p>My dream part-time job for my time at university would be stage management for the student theatre. i'd be such a cool crew member. black tee, black dust mask, obnoxious amount of pins on my 'CREW' lanyard, thumbs up from the wings. maybe even a butch lookin crew cut. id fit that lifestyle so well. I had the opportunity to be stage manager for a big recieving house this year, but navigating a city i dont live in late at night to get home scared me too much to take them up on it. also i dont drive and public transport shuts down at like 10. So, being able to live a 2 minute walk from the theatre would be game changing. obvs i'd drink up being centre stage, but ive heard student theatre can be intense backstage. and after 2 years of the most ridiculous drama thirsty college circles? i'm too tired for that. (though. now i think about it. the best cure for drama is being too bloody tired to deal with it. sorry jess. i actually dont care that you think they should ban people who arent doing BA drama from auditioning. im trying to blow you up with my mind.)</p><p>I'm most worried about coming back home after being able to do my own thing for a while. (sorry mum; i dont have a lovely respectable boyfriend. no, i know. but! unrelated. sasha and I are going on a two week long retreat to the scottish highlands. yes isnt it lovely what best friends do. mhm.)</p><p><br></p><p>On my last day at work, my coworker said 'oh, i hope you'll be alright.' </p><p>and i said 'I will be. i'll make myself be alright'</p><p>and i think that's the attitude ive got to keep. i'll do no harm, but i'll take none either.</p>

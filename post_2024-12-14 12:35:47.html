<p>ah, the hamlet edition!  I worry I might have just changed a life. from a mcdonalds? society tradition decrees that the casting conversations and decisions must be made from the mcdonalds on the roundabout. its just the rules. and also that we cannot leave the mcdonalds until the list is made- so most directors leave at 2am to 4am. we were done and posted by 11:45. we left mcdonalds to tell the backstage manager IN PERSON because he was just on his way back from a backstage meeting. that is a society record. </p><p>Even the president sent us a message in the morning asking us how the hell we managed it. In truth, the answer is that we had the exact same number of auditionees as we did roles, so it was more a case of slotting together a jigsaw than it was anything else.</p><p>That being said, our hamlet has been vying for this role since day one. since the night my codirector dropped that he wanted to pitch hamlet at all. and so our hamlet (who has been tenderly nicknamed bernard black. because he looks and acts like bernard black from hit channel 4 sitcom black books) has been learning this show inside and out, and came into the audition with absolute desperation in his eyes. and when someone talks big game about wanting a role and working day in day out for it, there is nothing in the world one wants more than to not cast them. so when he comes in and blows the monologue out of the damn water, [without a script in hand!] all three of us groan. there really was no competition! we had a wobble with The Boys (hamlet, horatio and laertes) where the three who were eventually cast in those roles went through phases of being written down as all three of those roles. (the thing that sold it was how each of them would play laertes, funnily enough) but even then our horatio was at some point pencilled in as... every role. from hamlet to claudius to gravedigger. not a stone was left unturned. it seriously felt like defusing a bomb, or planning a military campaign. lives were at stake. Bernard Black gave me two hugs the day the cast list dropped. which is a crazy jump from the zero we exchanged in the past three months of knowing each other. this really does mean the world to him and its wild to think that I did that without really realising at a mcdonalds.</p><p>But, the work isn't done! i've tasked myself with compiling resources for all of the major characters, so they can get used to the language and the relationships they have with the other characters. So far i've finished Hamlet's, which is the main one and is sitting pretty at 1,800 words. yikes. [I got that done in one morning. My english coursework was 1700 and it took me three weeks. embarrassing.] The one i'm just about to wrap up is Horatio's and that's only 600 words. It should be a fun little project to work on over the christmas holidays though, so i can't be mad.</p>

<p>Letter #001</p><p><br></p><p>Is it perhaps optimistic to think there's going to be at least 100 letters? maybe. does a triple-digit index look cool? definitely.</p><p>I have been at university for less than a week! and yet it feels like a lot more than a week! and also somehow a few hours!</p><p>Although my prologue letter sounded very confident; during the week running up to having to drive those hours to a brand new city, all that confidence seemed to vanish. I was well and truly bricking it. It mostly felt surreal, like it wasn't REALLY going to happen. Maybe a fairy would whisk me away, or i'd get hit by a meteor from space, or the school would send me an email titled 'GET PRANK'D LOOL' and tell me i wasnt actually invited.</p><p>But, lo and behold, i am here. in my tiny room, with my massive kitchen, and my four lovely flatmates. So far, everyone seems genuinely angelic. not a single rift or bit of friction. Maybe as time moves on and the novelty of being on our own wears off, things will change. But so far we love to climb out of the kitchen window and onto the secret balcony (the door to it is locked and none of us have a matching key.) and to dance horrendously to music whilst cooking. </p><p>The big changes don't seem to bother me as much. At least not yet. I don't mind having to wipe down counters or take the bins out. I'm even excited to go to the launderette. It's the little changes that throw me off and remind me that i'm actually away from home. This morning i turned on my analogue radio for the first time since getting here, and I had to re-tune it because i'm far enough away from home that the frequency for Radio 1 is slightly different. That's kind of insane to me. Similarly, google maps showed me a detailed and annotated city when i opened it, instead of sprawling green nothingness -- my IP changed when i connected to the 'net here. </p><p>Being in the school of Creative Arts is incredible too. Everyone i meet is just as nerdy and silly as i am, and i don't have to awkwardly explain my degree to them. they get it! I had an introductory lecture about using some of the online resources earlier today, and the whole room got sidetracked discussing the writing of Chibnall in Doctor Who, Prof included! it's so refreshing and fun. I also seem to be developing a reputation in my course for having cool clothes? which is insane?? i severely underpacked my wardrobe and have already worn everything twice &gt;M&lt;</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes i worry that these years will pass me by and I won't have done anything with them, but sometimes i sit on the windowsill with my flatmates as we cook sweet potatoes in the dark, and I can't help but feel so foolish for thinking it would be anything but wonderful.</p>

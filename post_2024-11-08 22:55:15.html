<p>Letter #006 </p><p><br></p><p>I'm writing this at work, about to do the sound desk for the local boozy bingo.&nbsp;I caught a cold from god knows where but its really trying to knock me out. it doesnt help that shifts at work have picked up and I actually finished my wednesday shift at 5am yesterday. I'm off next week though, so I will be taking that time to rest as best as I can (school permitting) </p><p>I feel like i spend most of my letters flip-flopping between 'i hate my job' and 'i adore my job' but rest assured that is because that's how i spend most of my waking time. every time i'm getting ready before a shift all i can think about is how much i hate my job, but the second i step inside i cant ever imagine quitting. i think i'd just like nicer hours and less 10+ hour shifts. that would probably do it for me.</p><p>I think this is when the weeks stop being novel, and finding interesting things becomes difficult. which is also the exact time where these letters become more important for keeping morale up. it's kind of amazing how different 6 weeks can feel. this time last year, 6 weeks felt like nothing. now 6 weeks ago feels like a lifetime. I've met people who I'll probably be friends with for life. which is silly, actually. what do you mean some randomer from hull is now my closest confidant at 2am after a social? come on, get real. On a similar note, if you told me 6 weeks ago that I'd (a) be a main in the first show of my time in the drama soc i'd laugh and then cry, AND (b) DIRECTING the next show immediately after? well. that's not a funny joke. apparently there have only ever been one other set of first-year directors in the past 5 years. and we nearly pitched the same show they did [a midsummer night's dream]. which wouldnt have been ideal at all. so, Hamlet it is! my co-director is lovely, but so intense and extroverted that it becomes a little intimidating. which is actually kind of perfect for a shakespeare director.</p><p>We are [to put it lightly] absolutely terrified of producing Hamlet, since it famously requires A Hamlet. in fact, we've even been discussing holding auditions before pitching the show, since it falls apart if we can't get that one thing. as co-director, i've been given the admirable role of 'female character sorter' which is. ..okay sure. don't get me wrong; i'm about to produce the best ophelia the world has ever seen, but being handed all of the female characters in one fell swoop feels a little bit like my co-director went 'ah! you know women! quick! make this pass the bechdel test!' i have to laugh about it, otherwise i might go a little insane i think?</p><p>Still, scripts are being annotated and mockups are being drafted. i think it's going to be a really fun ride!</p><p><br></p><p>BREAKING NEWS: SO, the people who run the bingo sometimes run a little late. but soundcheck is always at 5:30 and they have never, ever been late for a soundcheck. usually theyre here on time at 5pm, but have absolutely never been later than 5:15. but 5:15 rolled around and there was no sign of them. and then 20 past, then half past [meaning we officially had a 'Delayed Start']. it was at that point that my coworker worriedly checked their website, and there was nothing under today's date. and on our venue website, there was nothing under today's date. we asked the big boss manager to check, and she disappeared for a little bit, until quarter to six, when we saw her sprint across the hall with a phone in one hand and the head of security in another. it was a ghost gig! there was never a boozy bingo booked, but it ended up in the calendar at some point and never got double checked. my 12pm-12am shift got cut by five hours. i think this is the first time in days i've been home from work early enough to make myself dinner and not just flop onto my bed. and let me tell you it has been a glorious evening. i had to revert to my default way of dispersing energy, which is putting on all of A Fever You Can't Sweat Out [ironic given that i actually can't sweat out this damn cold!] whilst i cooked [mash with herbs and cream, sausages, and fresh veg. and gravy for good measure!] and danced out a storm. i dont think ive done that since i was 12. I also curled up and watched Nye, which is on the <a href="https://youtu.be/hpN--d5bXSY" target="_blank">National Theatre youtube channel</a> until the 11th. i paused during the interval to write this, and i'll hopefully watch act 2 tomorrow, but i'm enjoying it immensely. micheal sheen the man that you are. </p>

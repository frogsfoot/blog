<p>letter #002</p><p><br></p><p>classes have officially begun and im getting into a nice rhythm and schedule. I had an audition on monday evening and im feeling pretty good about it! since it's my first show/year/term, im not really expecting a role in the show. as much as i would be over the moon about getting in, i did it more to get my foot in the door and say 'look. i care about this thing and i want to be considered in the future, and also i want more theatre kid friends' but then i ended up absolutely serving so we will see.</p><p>School is generally going well, i have one lecture a week and everything else is seminars and workshops. makes sense given that it's a very skills heavy course, but it sounds pretty hard to justify so i just call all of my sessions 'lectures' to sound smarter. probably doesnt help that about 3 hours after the weekly lecture we have a seminar about the lecture to make sure our stupid artist heads understood what was going on. </p><p>i'm writing this pretty much just after a shift at work, as a [massive drum roll please] STAGE TECH!!! raaah!! this was my third shift, and it feels so good. there's something about tinkering around a stage that fulfills the depths of my bones. the shifts are short and the pay is short, so it really is more of an enrichment thing for me. everyone at work is so lovely, but there's a massive problem in the industry for 'old-fashioned values' and as i do not look like a lovely little chap with big strong arms and a proper brain on my head, i am a prime target. So far nothing insane has happened, but one of my coworkers did pull me aside on my first day and stare directly into my soul as she told me 'do not go near the lorry driver. do not go inside the lorry without me. do not talk to anyone from outside our crew and be prepared to be given shit work (i.e petty tasks and busy-work)" and then about 2 hours later i was indeed inside the lorry alone with the truck driver. everything turned out fine he just pretended i wasnt there and smoked a cig (inside the lorry!)</p><p>a funny side effect of this is that some of my coworkers tread absolute EGGSHELLS around me and the women of the crew. the de facto head assistant refuses to call me anything except 'mate' with intense fear in his voice. earlier today he said 'look out babes im comin through' to the male coworker next to me, and then freaked out when i instinctively went 'alright cool'. the poor man was sweating. </p><p><br></p><p>in other news: i feel very creatively charged, and just finished rewatching otgw for the 3849th time. and i will watch it again next year. or maybe even later this year bc i just discovered that my copy of the show comes with three different audio tracks, the usual show audio, and then one for cast and crew commentary, and the last one being just for the score! neato! maybe i'll dust off my old poetry archive and start updating it with all the poems i end up writing on/for my course, who knows.</p>

<p>letter #003</p><p><br></p><p>Hello again! i'm writing these a lot more often than i initially expected, but so much stuff is happening all the time! Classes are chugging along and even though only one of my modules has any pre-lecture readings, i'm already falling behind with them because they're practically in a different language. sorry chaucer. I've had my first few workshops and feedbacks already, the big one being for my poetry module where i had to present a selection of haikus and got some lovely comments about them, but as always it is my titles that let me down. what the hell is a title anyway.&nbsp;BUT the person who teaches that module (can i call her a professor? she's the only one without a doctorate) is a literal angel sent from the skies for real. I told her that i never understand titles and she sent me the loveliest email with some theory pieces and some reassurance. </p><p>In my last letter (as per my prior correspondence,,,) i said I had just done an audition, but wasnt expecting much. The results came out about a week ago, and to my absolute shock i got the <em>second female lead.</em> WHAT?</p><p>&nbsp;WHJAT???? WHO WHAT WHEN WHERE WHY AND HOWWW? </p><p>&nbsp;fun anecdote! when i read that email i screamed at such a pitch that my flatmate seriously mistook me for the fire alarm. it was such a shock! and even now, after rehearsals have started and i've met the rest of the cast, i read through some of these lines and go 'oh my god they trusted me with this scene? wowie :D' it's humbling and gratifying and incredible all in one. i can't wait to do more and get silly with it. </p><p>In other news, I went to visit my best friend, who's in a different university, a lot closer to the place where we both grew up. I can't properly capture the magic i felt when i sat on the train and went past old landmarks that i'd recognise at any time of day or year. I haven't seen some of these places in years. We spent the first day watching films together. she got me into Rik Mayall's old stuff, so we mostly watched Kevin Turvey and made a start on the comic strip, since we wanted to experience those together. The sunday was insane because we ended up going for a walk through a nature trail and ended up in a suburb that looked identical to the one we grew up in. same architecture, same materials, same road quality, same inclines. we were able to find a corner shop just by going 'i feel like it would be here' and it was! we picked apples and wrote poems together. it really felt like something out of a fairy tale. </p><p>Similarly, i've JUST got back from a weekend back home. I dont think i'll make a habit of spending my weekends away, since it leaves me with a lot of work to do on monday morning (and also train tickets cost an arm, a leg, and your newborn child.) but going home for the first time in over a month was so strange. It felt less like coming back to my own house, and more like visiting a close relative, or a sibling. knowing that i was welcome but scared to put myself anywhere. i couldn't even get into my own pre-uni head. I spent most of saturday looking for a 3ds charger bc i didnt bring my own and i KNEW i had a spare somewhere. but i couldnt think of where i would put it. it wasnt anywhere usual at all, but i know that a month ago i would have pulled it out of thin air. When i came home, it turns out my original charger had finally kicked the bucket anyway. when the charging light went out on friday i assumed it meant my 3DS was charged, when in actual fact it meant that the charger had blown. I checked both of my consoles and it charged neither of them -- which was a relief compared to the alternative. it served me a good 11 years, 2 months and 14 days. rip king. if only i could find ur original heir. oh well.</p><p><br></p><p>I've got to go unpack my suitcase, toodles!</p>

<p>#009</p><p>I did not get shot at the callbacks!</p><p>I was however, one of three people to show up to the auditions. and the only one to show up on the first day. maybe to some that's a blessing, but to me it was absolute hell. three cast members took an evening out just for One Guy to show up. and one guy that they kinda dont even know too well. the awkward tension was palpable, and when they gave me 15 minutes to review the script in a side room, i just lied on the floor and went 'why? why???' until a security guard came up the stairs and i bolted upright.</p><p>After the audition, the director gave me the time and place for a callback on the spot [the next evening, during the second day of auditons], which i guess is unprofessional, but also would be ridiculously unwise of them not to considering there was nobody else. During the first audition i did a very good old man voice, but not the west country accent they wanted. during the callbacks i nailed the west country but forwent the old man voice. proof that i can do both! but i'll have to work on both &lt;em&gt;at the same time&lt;/em&gt;. Despite being run through two rounds of auditions, they are not over! i have a third round yet to come! everybody give three cheers for chemistry checks! they are really putting me through the works to make sure im good for the role, which i shoudnt be upset about but oh my god i am so stressed. On the bright side, i think the existing cast of jerusalem have been told by their director to get to know me, considering theyre all third years or masters students, and im decidely not. it's been kinda lovely having people i look up to come over to me and go 'hi!!! hello!! how are youuuu!!' That or they know i'm running auditions in a week and want to get in my good books. which is funny but actually kind of incredibly stressful ???</p><p>I think this week its been really apparent that i am stressed and my workload is starting to catch up with me, because at least one person from almost every circle im in has gone 'woah. you look terrible!' to me in the past week. if not the past 3 days. which is why these letters keep coming out later and later, going from friday mornings to friday evenings to uh. thursdays. whoops. don't worry! i'm not keeping myself like this for long. i'll honestly probably calm down by this time next week, now that pitching forms have been sent off and assuming i can get at least one assessment done by the end of the week. the joys of having all of your work/project deadlines be the same day means that all of your stress disappears on that same day! </p><p>in much kinder news, i've now watched all three cornetto films! yipee for cinema and edgar wright. look at u go funky movie man. i also sat and watched scott piglrim with my friend who visited for the weekend, so that's four edgar wright films in half the months! never having seen a film in my life is finally paying off (being invited to movie nights with friends) and i feel SO vindicated! yeah ok no i haven't seen lord of the rings. but i know that when i do it is because a friend has lovingly locked me in a room with snacks and wont let me leave until i watch one of the most loved movie series of all time with them and other friends. is that not heaven?</p><p>to make up for the lateness and shortness of this letter, i'll probably do a mid-week hamlet exclusive, considering the pitch is tomorrow and auditions are on monday and wednesday. a lot is happening and i'll yap to anyone who will listen. about all of it. [want to hear about how i made an animation clock for a powerpoint from scratch? well you'll find out next week regardless!]</p>

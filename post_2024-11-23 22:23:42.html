<p>#008</p><p><br></p><p>We had snow!! it's offically winter! dear god. Absolutely no excuses for not taking vitamin D now, especially considering it was dark at 3:50pm today. (what??) i had a friend come visit from home and sleep over, so we stayed up watching films (saw scott pilgrim vs the world for the first time!) and chatting and the like. so waking up at noon and having 3 hours of sunlight was not an easy experience. perhaps one might go as far as to say it was awful. And as it's now winter, i've been getting more and more festive as the days go on. first it was a cheeky wham listen, and now it's turned into sitting on my bedroom floor cutting out squareflakes and watching Nativity! (2009) whilst chomping down candy canes like it's no man's business. </p><p>The snow on monday night was incredible. some of my flatmates and i were walking back through the town centre when it started, and being surrounded by old buildings in the snow felt like something out of a postcard. i then sort of ruined my life by taking them to the campus pub and introducing them to some of my castmates, who were coming there after a writing workshop. And the thing about my flatmates is they know everything that happens in rehearsals because i tell them, and my castmates know a lot about what happens in the flat because i'll bring it up at rehearsal. so giving these people faces for the names was like showing someone the fluttering tail of toilet roll in flight, handing them a fresh roll, then asking them not to throw toilet roll at a tree marked 'I AM PERFECT TO THROW TOILET PAPER AT'. nothing was sacred, least of all my dignity. they worked together to torment me and i cannot blame them because i made these forces meet. we all went home together and by now the snow had picked up in vigour and had started to settle so we in fact did not go home and instead had a snowball fight in the road! midnight snowball fights are where it is at, we were slipping and sliding and pelleting like there was no tomorrow. at one point some of us snuck onto the roof and threw snowballs from up there like medieval knights mocking peasants. bonds were formed. a true power trip that still hasnt worn off. </p><p>Rehearsals for the show are going well, we've now moved from post-rehearsal drinks at the campus pub to post-rehearsal spoons, because the campus pub closes at 10pm and spoons closes at midnight. im sure its not too long before we start pre-gaming rehearsal and then continuing for post-rehearsal spoons. In fact, i have an audition tomorrow and i'm sure it might devolve into post-audition spoons. which is probably a bad thing actually. The audition is for a 'private' production of Jerusalem, by Jez Butterworth. I say private because it's not related to the drama society or any local theatre, but instead a group of friends who all happen to be in the drama soc met up over the summer and started working on a production for fun, (and when the director of the show told me that in spoons, myself and the co-director for hamlet turned to eachother and said 'YOU CAN DO THAT??' and perhaps it is unwise to both be directing hamlet and working on a private show, but perhaps it will pay off, no?) but they now need to replace a character because the old person dropped out. so they've opened up the audition for people in the drama soc, and i'm going to have a crack at it. I'm incredibly nervous, but i have a strong feeling i'll make it to callbacks, and then i know i will feel even worse because anything can happen at callbacks. i could be shot at the callbacks. with a gun. </p>
